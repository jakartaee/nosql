== Jakarta NoSQL Providers

A Jakarta NoSQL provider might come as an integrated component of a Jakarta EE container or a separate component that integrates with the Jakarta EE container via standard or proprietary SPIs. For example, a Jakarta NoSQL provider might use a CDI portable extension to integrate with dependency injection.

Jakarta NoSQL providers play a crucial role in the ecosystem by interpreting the annotations provided by developers and implementing the corresponding Template interfaces. These providers handle operations related to entities according to the rules outlined in the Jakarta NoSQL specification.

By adhering to these rules, Jakarta NoSQL providers ensure seamless integration with the application via dependency injection. This integration allows developers to access the functionality provided by the Template interfaces without concerning themselves with the underlying database implementation details.

The Jakarta NoSQL specification sets clear guidelines for Jakarta NoSQL providers, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different providers. These rules enable multiple Jakarta Data providers to coexist within a system without interfering or overlapping at the same injection points. This level of standardization fosters interoperability and flexibility, empowering developers to choose the provider that best suits their project requirements.

=== Configuration and Credentials

Configuration and credentials for NoSQL databases are not standardized within the Jakarta NoSQL specification. Each Jakarta NoSQL provider is responsible for providing its own configuration mechanism, allowing developers to configure the connection to the NoSQL database according to their specific requirements.

The Jakarta NoSQL specification highly recommends following the Twelve-Factor App methodology, particularly the "Store config in the environment" principle. This approach advocates for storing configuration details such as database credentials, connection URLs, and other settings as environment variables. This practice promotes portability, scalability, and security by separating configuration from code and ensuring consistency across different environments.

=== Schema Generation

The process of creating a schema for a database is called schema generation. This process is not included in the Jakarta NoSQL specification. While some NoSQL databases allow schema definition and enforcement, many NoSQL databases are schemaless, which means developers can store data without defining a schema beforehand.

Therefore, the ability to generate a schema may differ depending on the NoSQL database and the Jakarta NoSQL provider being used. Some Jakarta NoSQL providers offer schema generation capabilities, while others do not.

For developers working with schemaless NoSQL databases, schema generation may not be necessary. This is because the database dynamically adapts to the structure of the data being stored. In such cases, the focus should be on organizing data to suit the application's requirements best, rather than defining a rigid schema.

In cases where schema generation is supported, developers should be aware that the process may vary between NoSQL databases and Jakarta NoSQL providers. Different databases may have unique requirements or conventions for defining schemas, and Jakarta NoSQL providers may offer different approaches or tools for schema generation.

Whether schema generation is necessary or beneficial depends on the specific use case, the NoSQL database being used, and the development team's preferences. Developers should consult the documentation of their chosen NoSQL database and Jakarta NoSQL provider for guidance on schema generation practices and considerations.

=== Jakarta NoSQL Providers Extensions

Jakarta NoSQL providers and NoSQL databases have the flexibility to extend the API according to their specific requirements. This extensibility allows providers to create new annotations or develop specialized versions of the Template API tailored to their unique features or functionalities.

However, it's essential to note that these extensions are specific to the respective provider or database and may not be compatible with others. As a result, there is no guarantee of compatibility between extensions developed by different Jakarta NoSQL providers or NoSQL databases.

Despite the lack of cross-compatibility, this extensibility empowers providers to effectively innovate and address specific use cases or requirements. By leveraging extensions, developers can harness the full potential of Jakarta NoSQL while benefiting from the diverse capabilities offered by different providers and databases.

=== Persistent Fields

A Jakarta NoSQL provider can read the annotation via runtime, for example, using reflection, or via build-time, for example, Java Annotation Processor.

Jakarta NoSQL provider runtime accesses the persistent state of an entity via either:

* property access using style property accessors defined by the Jakarta NoSQL provider for its respective field or
* field access, that is, direct access to instance variables.

When property access is used, the Jakarta NoSQL provider must define the conversion; the recommendation is the method signature convention for JavaBeans read/write properties, as determined by the JavaBeans `Introspector` class.

[NOTE]
====
The `Column` annotation should be at the field in both access types.

== Interoperability with other Jakarta EE Specifications

This section discusses Interoperability with related Jakarta EE specifications. When operating within a Jakarta EE product, the availability of other Jakarta EE technologies depends on whether the Jakarta EE Core profile, Jakarta EE Web profile, or Jakarta EE Platform is used.

=== Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection

Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is a foundational specification within the Jakarta EE Core profile, offering a robust dependency injection framework for Java applications. CDI facilitates the decoupling of components and manages their lifecycle through dependency injection, promoting loose coupling and enabling the creation of modular, reusable code.

CDI is crucial in integrating the Jakarta NoSQL template seamlessly into applications through the `@Inject` annotation in Jakarta EE environments. This integration allows developers to inject instances of the `Template` class directly into their application components, enabling straightforward access to its methods and functionalities.

With CDI and the `@Inject` annotation, developers can inject the `Template` instance and utilize its methods effortlessly, as illustrated in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
Template template;

// ...

List<Car> cars = template.select(Car.class).where("type").eq(CarType.SPORT).result();
----

The Jakarta NoSQL provider should also provide CDI qualifiers to work with multiple NoSQL databases through CDI. Developers can use these qualifiers to specify which database instance they want to inject, enabling flexibility and compatibility with different NoSQL data stores. Jakarta NoSQL providers typically supply annotations like `@DatabaseQualifier` to annotate the injection points.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@DatabaseQualifier
Template template;

@Inject
@DatabaseQualifier("another")
Template anotherTemplate;
----

The template implementation bean must have:

- qualifier type `@Default`, and
- the template interface as a bean type.

Thus, the implementation is eligible for injection to unqualified injection points typed to the repository interface, as defined by section 2.4 of the CDI specification, version 4.0.

NOTE: This specification does not restrict the scope of the template implementation bean.

==== CDI Extensions for Jakarta Data Providers

In environments where CDI Full or CDI Lite is available, Jakarta NoSQL providers can leverage CDI extensions to enhance the integration and discovery of entities or implementations. While Jakarta NoSQL does not prescribe a specific type of CDI extension, it does require Jakarta NoSQL providers to ensure that template implementations are injected into appropriate injection points, typically interfaces, without additional qualifiers.

It's important to note the distinction between CDI Full and CDI Lite: CDI Full, part of the Jakarta Web profile and Jakarta Platform, includes support for `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension`, whereas CDI Lite (Jakarta Core profile) does not. However, both CDI Full and CDI Lite support `jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension`.

To avoid conflicts between the `BuildCompatibleExtension` and portable `Extension` in CDI Full environments, Jakarta NoSQL providers can utilize CDI's `@SkipIfPortableExtensionPresent` annotation.

CDI provides a robust foundation for integrating Jakarta NoSQL repositories into Jakarta EE applications, offering flexibility and extensibility to meet diverse requirements and use cases.


=== Jakarta Bean Validation

Integrating Jakarta Bean Validation into Jakarta NoSQL ensures data consistency within the Java layer by enforcing validation rules and constraints on data objects. By applying validation rules, developers can maintain data integrity, improve data quality, and enhance the reliability of their applications.

Jakarta Validation offers several advantages for Jakarta NoSQL applications:

1. It helps identify and prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being processed or persisted, reducing the risk of data corruption.
2. Catching validation errors early in the Java layer allows developers to identify and resolve potential issues before further processing or persistence occurs, leading to more robust and reliable applications.
3. Jakarta Validation supports declarative validation rules, simplifying the validation logic and promoting cleaner, more maintainable code.

In Jakarta NoSQL, template implementations are subject to method validation as specified in the "Method and constructor validation" section of the Jakarta Validation specification. This validation includes checking for constraints on method parameters and results. Automatic validation using these constraints is done by delegating validation to the Bean Validation implementation when inserting, updating, or deleting data through the methods.

Let's consider an example demonstrating the usage of Jakarta Bean Validation annotations in the `Student` entity class:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Student {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @Column
    @NotBlank
    private String name;

    @Positive
    @Min(18)
    @Column
    private int age;
}
----

In this example, the `name` field is annotated with `@NotBlank`, indicating that it must not be blank. The `age` field is annotated with both `@Positive` and `@Min(18)`, ensuring it is a positive integer greater than or equal to 18.

To execute validation before inserting data using Jakarta NoSQL templates, developers can simply invoke the `insert` and `update` methods on the template instance:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private Template template;
...
// Execute the validation before inserting the data.
template.insert(student);
----


=== Jakarta Data

Developers can seamlessly incorporate common data patterns, such as repositories, into their codebase by integrating Jakarta NoSQL with Jakarta Data.

Jakarta NoSQL providers that support Jakarta Data typically scan interfaces marked with the `jakarta.data.repository.Repository` annotation. This annotation serves as a marker for repositories, providing a standardized way to define repository interfaces.

By embracing Jakarta Data, Jakarta NoSQL providers enable Java developers to use standardized data patterns and techniques when defining entities and repositories. This compatibility ensures interoperability with other technologies and frameworks, fostering a cohesive and streamlined development experience.

=== Jakarta Query

*Jakarta Query* is a specification that defines an object-oriented, portable, and extensible query language for persistence technologies. It is designed to unify how queries are expressed across various persistence models — including both traditional relational databases and NoSQL systems.

Jakarta NoSQL builds on top of *Jakarta Query Core* as a foundational requirement. This core language provides a minimal but expressive set of constructs — such as filtering, ordering, selection, and updates — that serve as the base for querying entities in a database-independent way.

Although the syntax is consistent across databases, actual query behavior may vary depending on the underlying NoSQL provider. For instance:

- Some databases may impose implicit result limits.
- Others may rely on eventual consistency for query visibility.
- Certain functions or expressions may not be supported uniformly.

Jakarta NoSQL providers are responsible for translating Jakarta Query into the native query dialect of the target NoSQL database, while handling mapping between query results and Java entities or projections. This delegation preserves query portability while respecting the constraints and capabilities of each NoSQL engine.

By integrating Jakarta Query, Jakarta NoSQL enables expressive, declarative, and vendor-neutral queries — all while embracing the diversity and flexibility of NoSQL databases.

==== Query Limitations in NoSQL Providers

While Jakarta NoSQL offers a unified query interface based on Jakarta Query Core, the actual capabilities and behaviors can vary significantly depending on the underlying NoSQL database type. These limitations are inherent to how each database model handles data access, indexing, and consistency.

Below are key considerations by NoSQL category:

===== Key-Value Databases

Key-Value stores provide the most limited querying capability:

- Only equality (`=`) comparisons are typically supported on the primary key attribute (`jakarta.nosql.@Id`).
- Queries like `FROM Entity WHERE id = :id` are supported.
- DELETE operations behave similarly — only by `jakarta.nosql.@Id`.
- UPDATE operations are **not supported**.
- No support for filtering by other fields or complex expressions.

===== Wide-Column Databases

Slightly more expressive than Key-Value:

- Support for equality (`=`) on `@Id` is standard.
- Some providers allow filtering on other fields (e.g., `>`, `<`, `IN`), but **require secondary indexes**, which may degrade performance.
- UPDATE and DELETE require `@Id` and follow the same constraints as SELECT.
- Advanced conditions may or may not be supported depending on the database and index setup.

===== Document Databases

Document databases offer the most flexible query model:

- Support filtering across multiple fields, not just `@Id`.
- Enable use of a wide range of operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `IN`, `AND`, `OR`, etc.
- Typically support SELECT with `ORDER BY` and pagination-style features.
- Full support for UPDATE and DELETE operations.
- Better suited for expressive queries in Jakarta Query.

===== Graph Databases

Graph providers generally offer capabilities comparable to document databases:

- Allow deep filtering, traversals, and querying associated nodes/relationships.
- Full SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations are often supported depending on the graph engine.

*Other or Custom NoSQL Providers*

If a NoSQL database does not fit clearly into any of the categories above, it must support **at least the capabilities defined by the Key-Value model** — that is, equality conditions on `@Id` for SELECT and DELETE operations. Additional support is welcome and encouraged, as long as it respects Jakarta Query Core semantics.

*Function and Time Expression Limitations*

Many NoSQL databases — regardless of type — **do not natively support scalar or time-based functions** in their query engines. This includes operations such as:

- `LENGTH(...)`, `LOWER(...)`, `UPPER(...)`, `ABS(...)`
- Time-based comparisons like `NOW()`, `CURRENT_DATE`, etc.

Because these operations are typically executed at the database level, they may not be portable or reliable across NoSQL providers. Implementations may throw `UnsupportedOperationException` or defer evaluation to the application layer (if applicable).

IMPORTANT: Always validate your provider’s capabilities before using advanced expressions or functions. The goal of Jakarta NoSQL is to offer a consistent API while honoring the operational realities and limitations of each NoSQL technology.
