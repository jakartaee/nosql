=== Models Annotation

As previously mentioned, the Mapping API provides annotations that make the Java developer's life easier. These annotations can be categorized in two categories:

* Annotation Models
* Qualifier Annotation

==== Annotation Models

The annotation model converts the entity model into the entity on communication, the communication entity:

* Entity
* Column
* Id
* Embeddable
* Convert
* MappedSuperclass
* Inheritance
* DiscriminatorColumn
* DiscriminatorValue
* Database

Jakarta NoSQL Mapping does not require getter and setter methods to fields. However, the Entity class must have a non-private constructor with no parameters.

===== @Entity

This annotation maps the class to Jakarta NoSQL. There is a single value attribute. This attribute specifies the column family name, or the document collection name, etc. The default value is the simple name of the class. For example, given the `org.jakarta.nosql.demo.Person` class, the default name will be `Person`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Entity("ThePerson")
public class Person {
}
----

An entity that is a field will be incorporated as a sub-entity. For example, in a Document, the entity field will be converted to a sub-document.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;
}
----

[source,json]
----
{
   "_id":10,
   "name":"Ada Lovelave",
   "address":{
      "city":"São Paulo",
      "street":"Av Nove de Julho"
   }
}
----
===== @Column

This annotation defines which fields that belong to an Entity will be persisted. There is a single attribute that specifies that name in Database. It is default value that is the field name as declared in the class. This annotation is mandatory for non-Key-Value database types. In Key-Value types, only the Key needs to be identified with `@Key` - all other fields are stored as a single blob.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Column
    private String nickname;

    @Column("personName")
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;

    // ignored
    private String address;
}
----

===== @Id

This annotation defines which attribute is the entity's ID, or the Key in Key-Value databases. In such a case, the Value is the remaining information. It has a single attribute (like `@Column`) to define the native name. Unlike `@Column`, the default value is `_id`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class User implements Serializable {

    @Id
    private String userName;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;
}
----


===== @Embeddable

This annotation defines a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part of an owning entity and share the identity of that object. The behaviour is similar to `@MappedSuperclass`, but this is used on composition instead of inheritance.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Column
    private String title;

    @Column
    private Author author;
}

@Embeddable
public class Author {

    @Column
    private String author;

    @Column
    private Integer age;
}

----

In this example, there is a single instance in the database with columns `title`, `author` and `age`.

[source,json]
----
{
   "title":"Effective Java",
   "author":"Joshua Bloch",
   "age": 2019
}
----

===== @Convert

This annotation allows value conversions when mapping the value that came from the Communication API. This is useful for cases such as to cipher a field (String to String conversion), or to convert to a custom type. The Converter annotation has a single, mandatory parameter: a class that inherits from `AttributeConverter` that will be used to perform the conversion. The example below shows how to create a converter to a custom `Money` class.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    
    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Job job;

    @Column("money")
    @Convert(MoneyConverter.class)
    private MonetaryAmount salary;
}

public class MoneyConverter implements AttributeConverter<MonetaryAmount, String> {
    
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(MonetaryAmount appValue) {
        return appValue.toString();
    }
    
    @Override
    public MonetaryAmount convertToEntityAttribute(String dbValue) {
        return MonetaryAmount.parse(dbValue);
    }
}

public class MonetaryAmount {
    private final String currency;

    private final BigDecimal value;

    public String toString() {
        // specific implementation
    }

    public static MonetaryAmount parse(String string) {
        // specific implementation
    }
}
----

===== Collections

The Mapping layer supports `java.util.Collection` (and subclasses as defined below) mapping to simple elements such as `String` and `Integer` (that will be sent to the communication API as-is), and mapping to `Entity` or `Embedded` entities.

The following collections are supported:

* `java.util.Deque`
* `java.util.Queue`
* `java.util.List`
* `java.util.Iterable`
* `java.util.NavigableSet`
* `java.util.SortedSet`
* `java.util.Collection`

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;

    @Column
    private List<Address> addresses;
}

@Embeddable
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;
}
----

The above classes are mapped to:

[source,json]
----
{
   "_id":10,
   "addresses":[
      {
         "city":"São Paulo",
         "street":"Av Nove de Julho"
      },
      {
         "city":"Salvador",
         "street":"Rua Engenheiro Jose Anasoh"
      }
   ],
   "name":"Name",
   "phones":[
      "234",
      "432"
   ]
}
----

===== @MappedSuperclass

The class with the `@MapperSuperclass` annotation will have all attributes considered as an extension of this subclass with an `@Entity` annotation. In this case, all attributes are going to be stored, even the attributes inside the super class.

Using the MappedSuperclass strategy, inheritance is only evident in the class but not the entity model.

This means, that this annotation causes fields annotated with `@Column` in a parent class to be persisted together with the child class' fields.


[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Dog extends Animal {

    @Column
    private String name;
}

@MappedSuperclass
public class Animal {

    @Column
    private String race;

    @Column
    private Integer age;
}
----

Notice that the `Animal` doest not have an @Entity annotation, as it won't be persisted in the database by itself.

On the example above, when saving a Dog instance, Animal class' fields are saved too: `name`, `race`, and `age` are saved in a single instance.

===== @Inheritance

The strategy to work with inheritance with NoSQL, you can active it by adding the @Inheritance annotation to the superclass.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Inheritance
public abstract class Notification {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private LocalDate createdOn;

    public abstract void send();
}
----

===== @DiscriminatorColumn

This annotation specifies the discriminator column for the inheritance mapping strategy.
The strategy and the discriminator column are only specified in the root of an entity class hierarchy.

If the DiscriminatorColumn annotation is missing, and a discriminator column is required, the name of the discriminator column defaults is "type".

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Inheritance
@DiscriminatorColumn("type")
public abstract class Notification {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private LocalDate createdOn;

    public abstract void send();
}
----

===== @DiscriminatorValue

This annotation specifies the value of the discriminator column for entities of the given type.

The DiscriminatorValue annotation can only be specified on a concrete entity class.

If the DiscriminatorValue annotation is not specified a provider-specific function will be used to generate a value
representing the entity type, the discriminator value default is the `Class.getSimpleName()`.

[source,java]
----

@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue("SMS")
public class SmsNotification extends Notification {

    @Column
    private String phoneNumber;

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending message to sms: " + phoneNumber);
    }
}

@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue("Email")
public class EmailNotification extends Notification {

    @Column
    private String phoneNumber;

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending message to sms: " + phoneNumber);
    }
}

@Entity
// the discriminator value is SocialMediaNotification
public class SocialMediaNotification extends Notification {
    @Column
    private String username;

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending a post to: " + username);
    }
}
----

===== @Database

This annotation allows programmers to specialize `@Inject` annotations to choose which specific resource should be injected.

For example, when working with multiple `DocumentRepositories`, the following statement are ambiguous:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private DocumentRepository repositoryA;

@Inject
private DocumentRepository repositoryB;
----

`@Database` has two attributes to help specify what resource should be injected:

* *DatabaseType*: The database type (key-value, document, column, graph);
* *provider*: The provider's database name

Applying the annotation to the example above, the result is:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Database(value = DatabaseType.DOCUMENT, provider = "databaseA")
private DocumentRepository repositoryA;

@Inject
@Database(value = DatabaseType.DOCUMENT, provider = "databaseB")
private DocumentRepository repositoryB;
----

A producer method annotated with the same `@Database` values must exist as well.
