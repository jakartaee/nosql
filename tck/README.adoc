= Jakarta NoSQL TCK
:toc:

== Introduction

The Jakarta NoSQL Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is a suite of tests designed to verify that a Jakarta NoSQL implementation is compatible with the Jakarta NoSQL specification. It ensures consistency and reliability across different implementations of the Jakarta NoSQL API.

Any Jakarta NoSQL module must pass this test suite to be considered compliant with the Jakarta NoSQL standards.


== Dependencies

You must add the appropriate TCK module dependency for the Jakarta NoSQL implementation you wish to test in your build file to enable the tests. Here is an example of how to configure it in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <jakarta.nosql.version>1.0.0</jakarta.nosql.version>
</properties>

<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.nosql</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.nosql-tck</artifactId>
    <version>${jakarta.nosql.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

== Configuration in Apache Maven pom.xml

The tests are run by the `maven-surefire-plugin`. Ensure that your `pom.xml` is configured correctly to include this plugin and scan for the necessary dependencies. Below is an example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${maven.surefire.plugin.version}</version>
            <configuration>
                <dependenciesToScan>
                    <dependency>jakarta.nosql:jakarta.nosql-tck</dependency>
                </dependenciesToScan>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

== Implementing `TemplateSupplier` and Defining it in SPI

The `TemplateSupplier` interface plays a vital role in the Jakarta NoSQL TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit). It allows developers to obtain a fully configured `Template` instance for interacting with NoSQL databases. By abstracting the complexities of database configuration and dependency injection, the `TemplateSupplier` simplifies the process of working with schema-based NoSQL databases.

=== Implementing `TemplateSupplier`

Your implementation must provide an instance of `Template`, which is expected to be fully configured and ready for interaction with the database.

Example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyTemplateSupplier implements TemplateSupplier {

   @Override
   public Template get() {
       // Set up database connection, credentials, and configuration
       return new MyTemplate();  // Return a Template instance connected to the database
   }
}
----

=== Defining `TemplateSupplier` in the SPI

To make your `TemplateSupplier` implementation available to the Service Provider Interface (SPI), follow these steps:

1. **Create the `META-INF/services` Directory:**
Create the directory `META-INF/services` at the root of your project.

2. **Create the SPI Configuration File:**
Inside the `META-INF/services` directory, create a file named `ee.jakarta.tck.nosql.TemplateSupplier` (the fully qualified name of the interface).

3. **Register Your Implementation:**
In this file, specify the fully qualified name of your `TemplateSupplier` implementation class. For example:

[source]
----
com.example.MyTemplateSupplier
----

=== Expectations

- **Database Lifecycle:**

  The `TemplateSupplier` is not responsible for managing the database's Lifecycle. The database is expected to be already running when the `Template` instance is created and returned. The `TemplateSupplier` is only responsible for setting up the `Template` with the necessary configuration to interact with the database.

- **Template Initialization:**

  When the `get()` method is invoked, it is expected that the `Template` instance will be fully initialized and configured to interact with the database. The database connection, credentials, and any necessary configurations must be provided during the `Template` instantiation.

  For example, your `get()` method might return a `Template` connected to a specific database, with authentication credentials and configurations loaded from a configuration file or environment variables.

=== Example SPI File

Here is how the `META-INF/services/jakarta.nosql.tck.TemplateSupplier` file should look:

[source]
----
com.example.MyTemplateSupplier
