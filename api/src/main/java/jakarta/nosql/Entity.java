/**
 * Annotates a class as an entity, representing a persistent class corresponding to a database structure.
 * <p>
 * Entity classes must adhere to specific rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>At least one field must be annotated with {@link Id} or {@link Column}.</li>
 * <li>Constructors must be {@code public} or {@code protected} with no parameters, or with parameters annotated with {@link Column} or {@link Id}.</li>
 * <li>Annotations at the constructor will build the entity and read information from the database, while field annotations are required to write information to the database.</li>
 * <li>If both a non-args constructor and a constructor with annotated parameters exist, the constructor with annotations will be used to create the entity.</li>
 * <li>Constructor parameters without annotations will be ignored, utilizing a non-arg constructor instead.</li>
 * <li>Entities should not have multiple constructors using {@link Id} or {@link Column} annotations.</li>
 * <li>Record classes can also serve as entities.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Enums or interfaces cannot be designated as entities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each entity must have a unique identifier, typically annotated with {@link Id}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following example demonstrates two classes, {@code Person} and {@code Address}, where a person has an address:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Entity
 * public class Person {
 *
 *     @Id
 *     private Long id;
 *
 *     @Column
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     @Column
 *     private Address address;
 * }
 *
 * @Embeddable
 * public class Address {
 *     @Column
 *     private String street;
 *
 *     @Column
 *     private String city;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Note: NoSQL databases may have varying behaviors regarding serialization, resulting in different storage formats based on the NoSQL vendor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The sample below demonstrates the use of records as entities:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Entity
 * public record Person(@Id Long id, @Column String name, @Column Address address) {
 * }
 *
 * @Embeddable
 * public class Address {
 *     @Column
 *     private String street;
 *
 *     @Column
 *     private String city;
 *
 *     public Address(@Column String street, @Column String city) {
 *         this.street = street;
 *         this.city = city;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see Id
 * @see Column
 * @since 1.0
